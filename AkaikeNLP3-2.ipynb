        "\n",
        "•\tObjective 1: Get the most frequent entities from the tweets.\n",
        "\n",
        "•\tObjective 2: Find out the sentiment/polarity of each author towards each of the entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Technology/Tools used:**\n",
        "\n",
        "•\tSpacy for tokenization, stop words removal, named entity recognition.\n",
        "\n",
        "•\tScispacy (“en_ner_bc5cdr_md” module having labels “Entity” for named entity recognition. (medical or bi medical named entities)\n",
        "\n",
        "•\t“en_core_sci_lg” module is used to cater to clinical dataset i.e; “tweets.json”\n",
        "\n",
        "•\tPandas for analyzing the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "•\tJson to reads the dataset to Dataframe.\n",

        "\n",
        "Step 1:  Installed spacy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 2:  Imported and loaded scispacy and its biomedical module “en_ner_bc5cdr_md”.\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 3:  “Json” format read to Dataframe using orientation “index”\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 4:  Cleaned “tweet_text” column. \n",
        "\n",
        "•\tNo duplicates or missing values in the Dataframe.\n",
        "\n",
        "•\tRemoved punctuations, emoji s and digits,\n",
        "\n",
        "•\tRemoved hyper link and hashtags, \n",
        "\n",
        "•\tRemoved words less than 2 characters\n",
        "\n",
        "•\tChanged to lower case, \n",
        "\n",
        "•\tRemoved extra trailing spaces, \n",
        "\n",
        "•\tCreated tokens, \n",
        "\n",
        "•\tRemoved stop words\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 5:  Extracted entity from “cleaned_tweet_text” column.\n",

        "Step 6:  Frequency of entities (solution to problem statement 1)\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Step 8:  Authors' sentiment analysis (solution to problem statement 2)\n",

        "**Approach to solve the problem :**\n",
        "\n",
        "•\tSpacy module “en_core_web_sm” did not recognise context related entity, tried few clinical module but  “en_ner_bc5cdr_md” biomedical  module of scispacy solved this problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "•\tData Cleansing and Entities Extraction were a crucial parts of the solution. Removing unnecessary elements from “tweet_text” consumed most of the time.\n",
